Glide-path RECOMMENDER — optimizes the equity weight at each step by simulation.

Given a household's horizons, spending flexibility, guaranteed income, and a capital-market
curve (equity weight → expected return + volatility), this returns the welfare-maximizing
equity weight at each step of a chosen interval (1y, 5y, …) across accumulation and
retirement. The path is found by SIMULATION (per-interval coordinate ascent under common
market paths), not from any hard-coded table or fitted formula — so it adapts to whatever
return mode, guaranteed income, and flexibility you feed it.

It is the productized form of the analysis in `docs/glide-path/methodology.md`
(`analysis/glide_path/research.py`): same model (real dollars, arithmetic-normal returns,
mid-year cash flow, absorbing-at-zero, CRRA utility), exposed as one function.

KEY INPUTS
----------
  accum_years, retire_years : lengths of the two phases (retirement is a fixed planning horizon).
  flexibility               : spending rule in [0,1]. 0 = constant real $ (rigid floor),
                              1 = fully flexible (spend `withdrawal_rate` of the live balance),
                              0.5 = half-and-half. Blends the two targets proportionally each year.
  withdrawal_rate           : the flexible-spending fraction of the live balance (used only when
                              flexibility > 0). E.g. 0.04 = spend 4% of current balance per year.
  guaranteed_income         : guaranteed real annual income in retirement (CPP/OAS/DB, in dollars).
                              Acts like a bond you own outside the portfolio: the higher it is, the
                              less the portfolio must fund. It is paid every retirement year
                              (guaranteed income starts at retirement; a pre-pension "bridge" is out
                              of scope — model that funding question separately).
  target_income             : the household's real annual spending target in retirement (dollars).
  annual_contribution       : real annual savings added during accumulation (dollars).
  current_savings           : portfolio balance at the start of accumulation (dollars).
  alloc_curve               : the capital-market assumptions, as anchors
                              [(equity_weight, mean_return, volatility), …] spanning w∈[0,1].
                              Interpolated to any weight. Units controlled by `returns_in_percent`
                              and deflated to real with `inflation`. Used only by `iid-mc`.
  inflation                 : annual inflation rate used to convert nominal returns to real.
                              Must match the units of `alloc_curve` (default: percent, i.e. 2.1).
                              Used only by `iid-mc`.
  returns_in_percent        : if True (default), `alloc_curve` means/vols are in % per year.
  return_mode               : "forward-block" (default — history rescaled to forward-CMA
                              marginals, then block-bootstrapped; previously "iid-mc"),
                              "historical-iid" (paired stock/bond years sampled with
                              replacement), "historical-block" (paired stock/bond years sampled
                              with a stationary circular block bootstrap), or "forward-block"
                              (historical sequences rescaled to the forward-CMA marginals, then
                              block-bootstrapped).
  block_years               : average years per historical block (default 10). Used only by the
                              block modes; realized block lengths are geometric.
  dataset                   : "pooled" (default — single-country sequences; previously "world")
                              or "world" (equal-weight cross-country average)
                              (each country's own sequence concatenated). Historical modes only.
  exclude_countries,
  exclude_years             : drop countries / inclusive year windows from the pooled dataset.
  max_leverage              : cap on the equity weight. 1.0 = no leverage (default); 1.5 = the
                              optimizer may borrow to hold up to 150% equity. A weight w>1 borrows
                              (w−1) at `borrow_cost` to hold w in the all-equity portfolio, so its
                              real return is w·eq − (w−1)·borrow and its vol scales as w·eq_vol. A
                              leveraged wipeout is treated as ruin (balance floored at 0).
  borrow_cost               : the REAL annual cost of borrowing (same units as the curve, e.g.
                              2.0 = 2% real). Only matters when `max_leverage` > 1. Higher cost ⇒
                              the optimizer leverages less. The optimizer leverages only where the
                              risk-adjusted gain beats the borrowing drag — typically early
                              accumulation under a low γ ("lifecycle investing"); it avoids leverage
                              in retirement where sequence risk dominates.
  interval                  : years per glide step (1 = per-age, 5 = change allocation every 5y…).
                              Equity weight is held constant within each interval block.
  gamma                     : CRRA risk aversion applied to RETIREMENT CONSUMPTION. Higher = more
                              averse to consumption swings → lower equity. 1 ≈ log, 4 = base (default),
                              8 = very cautious. The user's chosen γ is their retirement-spending risk
                              aversion: higher γ penalizes low retirement-spending outcomes more
                              heavily across simulated market scenarios. This is distinct from
                              spending flexibility, which controls how spending responds to portfolio
                              value. There is no separate current or accumulation γ.
  beta                      : annual time-discount factor (default 0.985 → ~1.5% time preference).
                              Applied within retirement only: the first retirement year has weight 1,
                              then each year receives β times the previous year's weight. Choose 1 to
                              value all retirement years equally, 0.985 for a modest preference for
                              earlier years, or 0.97 to strongly prioritize early retirement. Over
                              30 years, the final-year weights are about 100%, 65%, and 41%.
                              Accumulation years are not discounted.
