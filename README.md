## Tools

| Tool                                                                         | Route          | Status |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| **Rent vs Buy** — compare renting vs owning a home                           | `/rent-vs-buy` | Live   |
| **When can I retire?** — quick retirement reality check                      | `/retirement`  | Live   |
| **Lifetime Allocation Optimizer** — compare dynamic and constant allocations | `/glide-path`  | Live   |

The site is a single statically-exported Next.js app: a hub landing page at `/`
links to each tool, which lives at its own route.

The Lifetime Allocation Optimizer compares an optimized equity path with the best constant
allocation. It reports drawdown-only depletion separately from full-path shortfall so the
trade-offs between both choices remain visible.

## Disclaimer

An educational tool, **not financial advice**. Results are estimates from your assumptions, not predictions. Canada-specific and provided as-is — consult a professional before acting.

## Development

Built with Next.js (App Router), React 19 (with React Compiler), TypeScript, Mantine, Tailwind CSS and Recharts. Statically exported and deployed to GitHub Pages. Tested with Vitest + React Testing Library (unit/component) and Playwright (e2e/UI).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # static export to ./out
npm run format     # Prettier
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm test           # Vitest unit + component tests
npm run test:e2e   # Playwright end-to-end tests
```

## Layout

```
src/
  app/
    page.tsx              # hub landing page (lists tools)
    rent-vs-buy/page.tsx  # rent-vs-buy tool route
    glide-path/page.tsx   # Lifetime Allocation Optimizer route
  components/
    shared/               # reusable chrome + form primitives (Header, Footer, inputs)
    rent-vs-buy/          # rent-vs-buy-specific components
    glide-path/           # Lifetime Allocation Optimizer components
  utils/                  # math, formatting, Monte Carlo (shared) + tool-specific logic
  types.ts                # shared domain types
```

Cross-folder imports use the `@/` path alias (`@/* → ./src/*`).
