# Lifetime Allocation Optimizer — Methodology and Research

Developer/research note for the Lifetime Allocation Optimizer. Companion to the
[`retirement` SWR methodology](../retirement/swr-methodology.md). It asks: **what equity weight
should you hold at each age — before and after retirement — to maximize lifetime welfare?**

The iid research baseline (Sections 2a–2e) uses our forward Canadian capital-market assumptions and
plain **iid Monte Carlo**. The productized Python recommender and the web app both **default to
forward-block pooled** — historical single-country return sequences affine-rescaled to the forward-CMA
marginals, then stationary-block-bootstrapped — so the results capture sequence risk while honoring the
user's return assumptions. **§2f re-runs the key scenarios under that default**, where the constant-$
bond tent largely disappears and the optimum becomes flat ~100% equity (the headline shift; see §2f and
§3a). **IID Monte Carlo** remains available as an optional mode in both interfaces.

The web and Python recommender share the baseline household/model defaults: flexibility 0,
γ = 4, β = 0.985, and a 4% flexible withdrawal rate. Their product
surfaces intentionally differ: the web app fixes the glide cadence at 5-year steps, uses
browser-sized path/pass caps, exposes fewer controls, and requires at least $10,000 of guaranteed
income. Python exposes the interval and historical return modes (with world/pooled dataset
choices), and accepts zero guaranteed income for research and CLI sensitivity cases.

This work is a deliberate cross-check on two backtest-based studies:

- **ACO** — Anarkulova, Cederburg, O'Doherty, _Beyond the Status Quo_ ([SSRN 4590406](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4590406)):
  a 38-country block bootstrap concludes the lifetime-utility optimum is **~100% equity, held
  flat** across the whole lifecycle (no bonds, no glide). Its constant-spending optimal profile
  (their Figure 3) is **flat ~100% through accumulation** with a shallow bills/bonds "tent"
  concentrated **right at retirement**, receding within a few years.
- **ERN** — earlyretirementnow.com [Part 20](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/09/20/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-20-more-thoughts-on-equity-glidepaths/):
  a US Shiller backtest finds a **rising** retirement glide (e.g. 60%→100%) adds ~0.1–0.3pp to
  the SWR, **but only when CAPE > 20**.

Simulation: [`analysis/glide_path/research.py`](../../analysis/glide_path/research.py)
(`python3 -m analysis.glide_path.research`; needs numpy + matplotlib). Figures it writes are in
gitignored `analysis/artifacts/glide_path/research/`.

The research sweep remains forward-CMA iid Monte Carlo. The web app and Python recommender both
default to forward-block pooled; iid-mc is available as an optional mode. The four supported
modes in the Python recommender:

```bash
# Default: historical sequences rescaled to forward-CMA marginals, then block-bootstrapped
python3 analysis/recommend_glide.py                         # forward-block pooled

# Forward-CMA normal iid Monte Carlo (original behavior)
python3 analysis/recommend_glide.py --mode iid-mc

# Raw paired world stock/bond years, sampled independently with replacement
python3 analysis/recommend_glide.py --mode historical-iid

# Raw paired world stock/bond years, sampled in stationary circular blocks
python3 analysis/recommend_glide.py --mode historical-block --block-years 10

# Historical sequences rescaled to the forward-CMA marginals, then block-bootstrapped
python3 analysis/recommend_glide.py --mode forward-block --dataset pooled
```

Historical modes use real paired stock and long-government-bond returns from the JST R6
Macrohistory workbook. `analysis/shared/jst_history.py` downloads it on first use to gitignored
`analysis/.data/`, deflates each asset by each country's CPI, and pairs the real returns by year.
`--dataset pooled` (default) concatenates each country's own sequence so a block samples
consecutive years of a single country; `--dataset world` averages countries within each
calendar year into one annually-rebalanced portfolio. Each sampled historical year keeps stock and
bond paired. Historical modes require pandas and openpyxl in addition to numpy. A custom `--curve`
and `--inflation` apply only to `iid-mc`.

The world series has no negative 20- or 30-year circular stock window, so longer average blocks can
make a 100% stock result optimal under this model — a property of bootstrapping the
already-diversified world series, not of the (stock/bond) candidate set.

## TL;DR

0. **The return model decides whether there's a tent at all.** Under **iid** (no recovery), constant-$
   spending wants a **derisking bond tent** and an interior **60–80%** level. Under the **default
   forward-block pooled** engine — which restores JST's empirical sequence structure (equity
   decade-scale reversion **jointly with** bond persistence; see §2f's channel factorial) — the tent
   **largely disappears**: the optimum is **flat ~100% equity**, best-flat is 100% in every cell, and the
   glide shape is worth **≈ $0** (§2f). The iid tent is a sequence-risk artifact of _assuming no
   recovery_; the joint recovery-and-bond-risk structure is real in history, and it reproduces
   **ACO's flat-100%** on our own CMAs.

1. **The spending rule decides the shape (within either model).**
   - **Constant real-dollar withdrawal** → _under iid_ the optimum **derisks into retirement** (a **bond tent**) then drifts up; _under the default forward-block_ this collapses to a shallow dip near 100%.
   - **Flexible withdrawal** (income allowed to move with the market) → optimum is **flat, high equity (~100%)** essentially throughout in **both** models — exactly **ACO's** prescription.
2. **The glide _shape_ is worth very little.** Tested out-of-sample, the per-age glide beats the best single **flat** weight by only **~$300/yr (~0.5%)** under iid, and **≈ $0 under the default forward-block** (and ≈ $0 whenever spending is flexible). The _level_ is what matters — and which level is right depends on the return model: **60–80%** under iid constant-$, **100%** under the default.

3. **Why the iid tent and ACO differ — and why the default closes the gap.** The iid constant-$ tent
   bottoms at/just after retirement (matching ACO's location) but its accumulation path **falls** rather
   than staying flat near 100%. That gap is the **missing recovery**: iid removes the decade-scale
   sequencing history carries (our 10-year average blocks restore it up to roughly the block length,
   attenuated beyond), so derisking looks worth it. Restore the recovery (forward-block, §2f)
   or add a bequest motive / higher premium, and our path moves to **ACO's flat-high** result.

4. **Both studies are right in their own world.** ACO's flat-100% is optimal _when spending is flexible (or wealth is valued), or once realistic mean reversion is in the model_; ERN/Kitces–Pfau's rising retirement glide is the _iid, rigid-spending_ shape — and even there ERN's CAPE-conditional SWR _boost_ does not reproduce under iid.

5. **A CRRA allocation recommendation requires some guaranteed retirement income.** If guaranteed
   income is zero, even a rare depleted year drives consumption to the numerical floor and makes CE
   tail-dominated. The web app therefore requires at least $10,000 of guaranteed annual income.
   Python accepts zero for sensitivity work and can still report depletion and the two candidate
   paths, but their allocation comparison is tail-dominated.

## 1. Method

Real (today's) dollars throughout. The **iid baseline** (§2a–§2e) uses iid normal returns, drawn each
year — **no** serial correlation, **no** valuation signal — so anything the optimizer likes there is
robust to the absence of mean reversion, by construction. §2f and the product default instead use
**forward-block pooled**, which reintroduces the historical sequencing iid strips out; the two together
bracket the answer (no-recovery bound vs realistic mean reversion).

### Python recommender return modes

All four modes feed the same lifecycle cash flows, utility objective, coordinate-ascent optimizer,
and independent evaluation-sample comparison:

- **`iid-mc`** maps each allocation to the app's forward-CMA real mean and volatility, then draws
  independent normal returns. Used by `analysis/glide_path/research.py` for the §2–§3 research
  sweep; the web app and Python recommender now default to `forward-block`.
- **`historical-iid`** samples raw historical years independently with replacement. Stock and the
  selected asset returns remain paired within a sampled year, but year-to-year ordering is removed.
- **`historical-block`** uses a stationary circular block bootstrap of paired asset-return years.
  Each next year continues the current historical sequence with probability `1 − 1/L` or restarts
  at a random year with probability `1/L`, so block lengths are geometric and average `L` years.
  The default `L` is 10 years, an annual approximation of the 120-month average used by ACO.
- **`forward-block`** affine-rescales each asset's historical series to the forward-CMA marginals
  (the same `w=0` and `w=1` mean/vol `iid-mc` uses), then block-bootstraps exactly like
  `historical-block`. Being affine, the rescale preserves each asset's _arithmetic-return_
  autocorrelation and the stock/bond correlation exactly; log-return statistics (e.g. the
  variance ratio) shift slightly under the ~2× vol shrink. This isolates _sequencing_ from the
  historical return/risk level — the missing cell of the marginals × sequencing factorial.

**What each mode actually does** (the distinctions that matter when reading results):

| Mode               | Preserves sequencing | Single-country sequence | Stock/bond pair kept | Uses forward PWL marginals |
| ------------------ | :------------------: | :---------------------: | :------------------: | :------------------------: |
| `iid-mc`           |       ✕ (iid)        |           n/a           | n/a (curve, no corr) |       ✓ (full curve)       |
| `historical-iid`   |       ✕ (iid)        |       pooled only       |          ✓           |     ✕ (raw historical)     |
| `historical-block` |          ✓           |       pooled only       |          ✓           |     ✕ (raw historical)     |
| `forward-block`    |          ✓           |       pooled only       |          ✓           | ✓ (`w=0` & `w=1` anchors)  |

Notes: (1) "Single-country sequence" holds only with `--dataset pooled` (the default); the
`world` dataset is the equal-weight cross-country average, whose sequence no single investor lived. (2) The
stock/bond _contemporaneous_ correlation is preserved in every historical mode because both series
are indexed by the same sampled rows; `forward-block` keeps the **historical** correlation while
matching forward marginals (intermediate-weight risk therefore comes from that historical
covariance, not the curve). (3) `forward-block` matches only the `w=0`/`w=1` anchors, not the
curve's interpolated intermediate-weight vols.

**Dataset and exclusions** (historical modes only): `--dataset pooled` (default) concatenates
each country's own sequence end to end, with segment ids that keep a block from bridging two
countries or a data/exclusion gap, so a block samples consecutive years of a single country.
`--dataset world` averages countries within each calendar year into one annually-rebalanced
portfolio.
`--exclude-countries` / `--exclude-years` (pooled only) drop disaster countries or windows.

For allocations up to 100% equity, each annual portfolio return is `w × stock + (1−w) × bonds`.
Above 100% equity, the leveraged return is `w × stock − (w−1) × real borrowing cost`, with no bond
position. The `historical-*` modes use raw
realized return levels; they do not re-center history to the forward CMAs (only `forward-block`
does). They are bootstrap backtests, not overlapping realized lifecycle windows. With the `world`
dataset, the block bootstrap resamples an already-diversified annual equal-weight-world
series; the default `pooled` dataset instead preserves single-country sequence risk. Either way these are
annual sequencing sensitivity checks, not an ACO replication (ACO bootstraps a monthly
country-level four-asset panel with 120-month average blocks, mortality-weighted horizons, and
terminal wealth in the objective — our annual 10-year blocks carry related but not identical
sequencing content).

### Returns — our own assumptions, no history

The app's allocation curve ([`presets.ts`](../../src/utils/retirement/presets.ts) `ALLOCATIONS`, PWL Capital-based, inflation 2.1%) is interpolated so **any** equity weight `w∈[0,1]` maps to a real arithmetic `(mean, vol)`. Endpoints: **100% equity → 4.67% real / 12.6% vol**; **0% equity → 1.42% real / 5.4% vol** ⇒ an equity premium of **~3.3pp** (vs the ~5pp the US-tilted history ACO and ERN lean on — see the [`retirement` SWR methodology](../retirement/swr-methodology.md) §2). Each year's return is `mean(wₜ) + vol(wₜ)·Z`, matching `monteCarlo.ts` (arithmetic normal, mid-year cash flow earns half a year, a depleted portfolio absorbs at 0).

### Household & phases

`START_AGE=35`, `START_SAVINGS=$200k`, income `$100k`, save **20%/yr** during accumulation,
target retirement income **60%** of income, of which **$20k** is guaranteed income (CPP/OAS/DB)
paid every retirement year — so the portfolio must fund a **$40k** gap. Accumulation consumption is
allocation-invariant, so it drops out of the objective; the accumulation glide matters only through
the **wealth distribution it hands to retirement**. Retirement is a **fixed planning horizon**
(`retire_years`), which makes "horizon" a clean axis (no mortality truncation; no bequest motive —
terminal wealth carries no utility).

### Spending rules — the income-variation axis

Each retirement year the withdrawal target blends a constant and a portfolio-proportional rule by
a flexibility knob **`FLEX∈[0,1]`**:

```
targetₜ = (1−FLEX)·$40k  +  FLEX·(4%·balanceₜ)
withdrawalₜ = min(targetₜ, affordable)      consumptionₜ = $20k guaranteed + withdrawalₜ
```

- **`FLEX=0` — constant $**: insists on the full $40k every year; income is rigid until the
  portfolio is exhausted (then drops to the $20k floor). This is the SWR / `/retirement`-tool world.
- **`FLEX=0.5` — semi-flexible**: half the target floats with the portfolio.
- **`FLEX=1` — fully flexible**: spends 4% of the _current_ portfolio, so income rises and falls
  with the market and the portfolio is never mechanically depleted. This is ACO's world.

### Objective & the per-age optimizer

Maximize expected discounted **CRRA utility** of retirement consumption (γ = 4 base; β = 0.985;
bequest weight 0). The control is the **equity weight at every age** (length = accumulation +
retirement years). We optimize it by **coordinate ascent**: hold all ages fixed but one, evaluate
that age over a 10pp equity grid on a **shared** shock matrix (common random numbers), take the
best, and cycle (alternating sweep direction) until the whole vector stops moving. CRN makes each
one-dimensional search exact for the drawn markets, and **no parametric shape is imposed** — so
flat / tent / monotone shapes all compete on equal footing. Coordinate ascent converges to a
**coordinate-wise** optimum, not a guaranteed global one; the shape-neutral flat init and the
alternating sweep direction mitigate but do not eliminate the risk of a local optimum
(most plausible under leverage with tail-dominated CE).

### Zero-income states and the CRRA impossible trinity

The model assumes guaranteed income is paid **every** retirement year. With positive guaranteed
income, consumption remains positive after portfolio depletion and CRRA's `u(c)` stays finite. The
bare `_FLOOR = $1` is then only a numerical guard and does not bind in the §2 scenarios.

A pre-pension bridge, or a plan with **$0 guaranteed income for all of retirement**, breaks that
assumption. Once the portfolio depletes, consumption falls to the numerical floor. Because
`u(c)→−∞` as `c→0`, with γ≥2 even a handful of `$1` consumption-years can dominate thousands of
otherwise successful paths. CE collapses toward the floor and the optimizer can select an
implausible allocation merely to avoid those rare cells.

We tested three approaches and found an **impossible trinity**: the model cannot simultaneously
provide all three of the following:

1. **No consumption floor or assumed fallback income.**
2. **A γ-responsive welfare objective.**
3. **Possible ruin while still producing one preferred allocation.**

Raw all-path CRRA preserves (1) and (2), but a ruined year has effectively unbounded negative
utility, so it cannot produce a useful comparison when (3) occurs. Assigning a finite utility value
to a broke year restores a comparison, but that floor effectively fabricates consumption the
household does not have. Scoring CRRA only over surviving paths avoids fabricated income, but under
target spending every survivor consumes the target by construction. Survivor CE therefore equals
the target for every γ; the objective collapses to γ-independent depletion minimization and, in
testing, recommended roughly the same 120–135% leveraged allocation from γ=1 through γ=12.

The chosen scope is therefore to preserve clean, all-path, γ-responsive CRRA and not model a
pre-pension bridge. That funding-feasibility question belongs to `/retirement`. A user-entered
**$0 guaranteed income is economically a permanent bridge** and recreates the same limitation: the
product labels the CE values as tail-dominated and presents the allocation comparison as
**inconclusive** rather than treating either candidate as a reliable recommendation. Depletion
metrics remain meaningful and are still reported.

Two honesty checks accompany every result:

- **Tent vs terminal artifact.** With bequest weight 0, the optimizer drives equity toward 0 in the
  _final_ retirement years (no future to grow for). That is a planning-horizon artifact, so we
  report the **tent** = lowest equity within 15y of retirement separately from the **terminal-year**
  equity.
- **Shape value, out of sample (§2e).** We re-score the optimized path on an **independent** shock
  draw against (a) flat 100%, (b) the best single flat weight, and (c) the optimal retirement glide
  with accumulation _forced_ to 100%. If the optimized accumulation shape doesn't beat flat-100% out
  of sample, we don't believe it.
- **Product recommender fallback.** The recommender applies one extra robustness guard: after
  coordinate ascent, the best constant allocation is chosen on its **own selection draw**
  (independent of both the optimization draw and the scoring draw — an argmax on the scoring
  draw would hand the constant comparator a selection advantage over the fixed glide), and then
  both the glide and that constant are scored on the same independent evaluation draw. The
  Python CLI flags the constant allocation as the robust choice when its
  CE beats the glide's by more than 5%. The web UI biases harder toward simplicity: it
  recommends the constant allocation whenever it wins on CE income outright, or comes within 2%
  on CE income **and** within 1pp on drawdown shortfall **and** within 2pp on full-path
  shortfall (`SIMPLICITY_*` thresholds in `src/components/glide-path/Result.tsx`). Either way
  the raw optimized glide stays charted and reported.

### 2a. SWR anchor (validates the engine; tests ERN under iid)

Retirement-only, constant $, 90% success — reproduces the `/retirement` tool and tests whether a
rising glide beats the best flat weight under iid.

| Horizon | Best flat (w\*) | Flat 100% | Rising 60→100 |
| ------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| 30y     | **3.66%** (50%) | 3.47%     | 3.65%         |
| 40y     | **2.99%** (65%) | 2.87%     | 3.01%         |
| 50y     | **2.61%** (70%) | 2.51%     | 2.63%         |

Matches the methodology doc (30y 3.67%, 50y 2.61%). The SWR-maximizing weight is **interior
(50–70%)**, not 100% — because the SWR is a pure left-tail metric. The rising glide ties the best
flat weight to two decimals; **it earns no SWR premium under iid**, confirming ERN's effect is a
CAPE/mean-reversion phenomenon absent from an iid world. (See `swr_anchor.png`.)

### 2b. Per-age optimal glide — retirement-horizon sweep (iid)

γ = 4, 30y accumulation. All columns are **equity %**. `tent` = lowest equity within 15y of
retirement (the retirement-date tent bottom) and the age it hits; `end` = terminal-year equity (a
no-bequest horizon artifact, not real). BEFORE/AFTER = slope of accumulation / of the retirement
approach into the tent.

| Spending      | Ret. horizon | start | acc. avg | pre-ret | @ret | tent (age) | end | BEFORE  | AFTER  | CE income | Deplete |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----- | -------- | ------- | ---- | ---------- | --- | ------- | ------ | --------- | ------- |
| constant $    | 30y          | 100   | 68       | 40      | 50   | 40 (@66)   | 100 | Falling | Rising | $55,825   | 6.3%    |

| constant $    | 50y          | 100   | 84       | 60      | 70   | 70 (@65)   | 40  | Falling | Rising | $47,101   | 15.9%   |

| semi-flex 50% | 40y          | 100   | 94       | 80      | 80   | 70 (@69)   | 100 | Falling | Flat   | $65,340   | 4.0%    |
| semi-flex 50% | 50y          | 100   | 94       | 70      | 80   | 70 (@67)   | 50  | Falling | Flat   | $60,516   | 7.8%    |
| flexible 100% | 30y          | 100   | 99       | 90      | 90   | 80 (@69)   | 0   | Flat    | Flat   | $68,459   | 0.0%    |
| flexible 100% | 40y          | 100   | 99       | 90      | 90   | 90 (@65)   | 0   | Flat    | Flat   | $66,123   | 0.0%    |
| flexible 100% | 50y          | 100   | 99       | 90      | 90   | 90 (@65)   | 0   | Flat    | Flat   | $64,139   | 0.0%    |

**Reading it:**

- **Constant $ → derisk into a tent, then drift up.** Equity falls through accumulation to a low
  **at/just after retirement** (40–70%), then rises. Income is near-rigid; the cost shows up as
  **depletion risk** (6–16%, rising with horizon). Longer horizons keep the tent shallower (70% vs
  40%) because a longer retirement needs more growth.
- **Flexible 100% → flat ~100%.** Equity is pinned near the top for the entire working and
  retired life; depletion is **0%** (proportional spending can't deplete) and the cost is borne as
  income variation. CE income is _higher_ than constant-$ ($64–68k vs $47–56k) — the value of
  letting income move is what unlocks the equity premium. (The `end = 0` column is the no-bequest
  terminal artifact, not a recommendation.)
- **Semi-flex is intermediate**, tipping from flat toward a mild tent as the horizon lengthens.

Longer accumulation lets a constant-$ saver derisk _earlier and deeper_ (more time for a smaller,
safer pile to still clear the floor → lower depletion: 26% → 1%). Flexible savers stay ~100%
regardless of accumulation length.

### 2d. Risk-aversion sensitivity (iid, 30y + 30y)

| Spending      | γ   | start | acc. avg | pre-ret | @ret | tent (age) | end | BEFORE  | AFTER  |
| ------------- | --- | ----- | -------- | ------- | ---- | ---------- | --- | ------- | ------ |
| constant $    | 2   | 100   | 68       | 40      | 40   | 40 (@65)   | 100 | Falling | Rising |

The **constant-$ tent is invariant across risk aversion** (the sequence-risk dip is structural —
driven by the spending rule, not by taste). For flexible spending, only at γ = 8 does
consumption-volatility aversion pull the saver off the 100% corner.

### 2e. Shape value — is the glide actually worth anything? (iid, out-of-sample)

Re-scored on an **independent** shock draw. CE = certainty-equivalent annual retirement
consumption. `opt ret / 100 acc` keeps the optimal retirement glide but forces flat 100% in
accumulation; `best flat` is the single constant weight that maximizes CE on the same independent
draw.

| Spending      | Ret. horizon | optimum | opt ret / 100% acc | flat 100% | best flat (w\*) | **glide vs best-flat** |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------- | ------------------ | --------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |

Two readings, both important:

- **The glide _shape_ is a rounding effect.** Over the best single flat weight it is worth
  **≤ ~$330/yr (~0.5%)**, and essentially nothing once spending is flexible. This is Estrada's
  "glidepath illusion."
- **The _level_ is not.** For constant-$, the optimum beats **flat 100%** by **$656–$2,039/yr**, and
  the optimal-retirement-glide-with-100%-accumulation is _worse_ than a flat 60% — i.e. **holding
  100% equity in accumulation is genuinely dominated** for a rigid-spending, no-bequest retiree. For
  flexible spending the best flat weight _is_ 100%, so there is nothing to gain anywhere.

### 2f. The default model: forward-block pooled — the tent largely disappears

The web app and Python recommender **default to forward-block pooled**, not iid. Re-running the §2b–§2e
scenarios under that engine (JST single-country sequences affine-rescaled to the forward CMAs, then
stationary-block-bootstrapped; per-age glide; γ = 4) changes the constant-$ answer qualitatively. The
decade-scale equity mean reversion forward-block preserves (VR(10y)≈0.91 — see §4; blocks averaging
10 years carry autocovariance up to roughly that horizon, attenuated beyond it) lets a high-equity
path recover in time, so the iid derisking incentive mostly evaporates.

**Retirement-horizon sweep (acc = 30y).** Compare directly to §2b.

| Spending      | Ret. horizon | start | acc. avg | pre-ret | @ret | tent (age) | end | BEFORE | AFTER   | CE income | Deplete |

**Shape value, out-of-sample (compare §2e).** The recommender's own independent-evaluation CE for the
optimized glide vs the best single constant weight:

| Spending   | Ret. horizon | optimum | best flat (w\*) | **glide vs best-flat** |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| constant $ | 30y          | $54,881 | $54,878 (100%)  | **+$3**                |
| constant $ | 40y          | $51,224 | $51,288 (100%)  | **−$64**               |
| constant $ | 50y          | $48,364 | $48,388 (100%)  | **−$24**               |
| semi-flex  | 30y          | $70,682 | $70,682 (100%)  | $0                     |
| flexible   | 30y          | $70,747 | $70,747 (100%)  | $0                     |

Differences of this size (±tens of $/yr on a ~$50k CE) are within Monte Carlo sampling error —
read them as "≈ $0", not as the flat weight genuinely beating the glide. (Both tables re-verified
to the dollar under the current engine — including the flat-comparator selection draw and the
income-shortfall depletion definition.)

**What changed from iid:**

- **The constant-$ accumulation path goes flat ~100%**, not falling-to-68. Equity at retirement is
  **85–95%** (iid: 50–70%), and the residual "tent" bottoms at **70–95%** (iid: 40–70%) — a shallow dip,
  not a bond tent.
- **Best-flat is 100% in every cell** (iid constant-$: 60–80%), and the **glide is worth ≈ $0** over it
  (−$64 to +$3). The §2e "level matters — hold 60–80%, not 100%" conclusion is **specific to iid**; under
  the default, **flat 100% wins** and the glide shape adds nothing measurable.
- **CE income is essentially unchanged** ($54.9k vs iid $55.8k at 30y) — the sequence model barely moves
  the achievable welfare; it moves the _allocation that achieves it_.

This is ACO's flat-~100% accumulation, reproduced on our own CMAs once historical sequencing is restored
(§3a). The cost of the higher equity now shows up almost entirely as **depletion risk** (5–12% for
constant-$, rising with horizon), which is the honest residual the recommender still reports. The mode
factorial in [`research_history.py`](../../analysis/glide_path/research_history.py) confirms the lever is
**pooled single-country sequencing**, not the marginals: `forward-block (pooled)` lands the same
high-equity optimum as `forward-block (world)`, while the raw-history `historical-block` modes (lower
premium) sit lower.

**Robustness: block length.** The flip does not hinge on the L = 10 default. Re-running the
constant-$ 30y+30y lifecycle (5y steps) across average block lengths:

| Avg block | best flat | acc. avg | tent |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | ---- |
| 1y        | **65%**   | 72       | 55   |
| 5y        | 100%      | 93       | 80   |
| 10y       | 100%      | 99       | 85   |
| 20y       | 100%      | 99       | 85   |
| 40y       | 100%      | 97       | 75   |

Best-flat is 100% for every L ≥ 5; only L = 1 — which destroys sequencing and reduces to an
iid resample of history — reverts to the interior-weight tent. The transition sits between 1y
and 5y blocks.

**Robustness: which channel flips it.** A factorial ladder on the same scenario isolates what
forward-block adds over iid (each cell = best flat weight): iid normal draws **60%**; adding the
historical stock/bond correlation (+0.29) to iid normals **55%**; the rescaled history's
non-normal marginal shapes sampled iid **70%**; block-sampling **equity only** (bonds shuffled)
**50%**; block-sampling **bonds only** (equity shuffled) **65%**; the full joint sequence
structure (the default engine) **100%**. No single channel — correlation, fat tails, equity
mean reversion alone, or bond persistence alone — produces the flat-100% answer; it emerges
only from the **joint** sequence structure, where bond persistence (VR(10y)≈1.7) makes long
bond holdings risky at the same time as equity's decade-scale reversion (VR(10y)≈0.91) makes
high equity recoverable. (Equity blocks alone actually _deepen_ the tent: history's short-run
momentum, VR(2y)≈1.1, raises near-horizon equity risk while iid-shuffled bonds stay safe.
The one-asset cells necessarily drop the cross-correlation, which the corr-only cell shows is
immaterial.) Reproduce both:
`python3 -m analysis.glide_path.research_history --sections blocks channels --accum 30 --retire 30 --savings 200000 --contrib 20000 --interval 5 --paths 8000`.

**Robustness: era and country cuts.** Same scenario with the history restricted before rescaling
(the forward anchors are unchanged, so only the sequencing pattern differs):

| History cut                         | bond VR(10y) | equity VR(10y) | best flat | CE at best vs 100% |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| full 1871–2020                      | 1.70         | 0.91           | **100%**  | —                  |
| post-1950                           | 2.27         | 0.95           | **100%**  | —                  |
| ex Germany + Japan                  | ~1.7         | ~0.9           | **100%**  | —                  |
| stable six¹                         | 1.96         | 0.73           | 80%       | +0.5%              |
| 1990–2020 (inflation-targeting era) | **0.50**     | 0.54           | **50%**   | +2.1%              |

¹ USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Sweden — no hyperinflation, occupation, or market closure.

The joint structure is **not** a Germany/Japan disaster artifact — it survives dropping them and is
_stronger_ in the stable-six cut. It **is era-dependent**: in the 1990–2020 cut, bond returns flip
from persistent to mean-reverting (VR(10y) 0.50, below the iid-null 5th percentile — largely the
secular rate decline), the stock/bond correlation drops to ≈0, and the optimizer returns the
interior bond tent. Three caveats on that cut: it is a single 31-year global regime (~16
cross-correlated copies of one sample path); its bond mean reversion is substantially the
one-off duration bull; and it ends in 2020 — excluding 2021–22, the one inflation-targeting-era
episode that looked exactly like the long-sample joint structure (persistent real bond losses,
equity recovery). Note also that every cut's CE-vs-flat-weight curve is shallow: the argmax moves
between 50% and 100%, but the welfare spread across that range stays ≤ ~2% of CE — the era choice

## 3. Does this validate or reject ACO and ERN?

| **ACO:** ~100% equity, flat across life                  | **Validated under the default forward-block model, and under iid conditional on flexible spending.** With flexible spending, flat ~100% is optimal in both models. With _rigid_ spending: under **iid** it is _not_ optimal (a ~60–80% derisking tent beats flat 100% by $650–$2,000/yr), but under the **default forward-block** model the tent collapses and **flat ~100% wins** (§2f) — ACO's result reproduced on our smaller ~3.3pp premium.  |
| **ERN / Kitces–Pfau:** rising equity glide in retirement | **An iid, rigid-spending shape — and shown to be sequence-risk, not valuation.** The derisk-then-rise glide emerges under pure iid (no CAPE>20 needed) but **largely vanishes under the default forward-block model** (§2f), because real mean reversion removes the no-recovery premium that creates it. ERN's specific claim — that the glide _raises the SWR_ — does **not** reproduce even under iid (§2a): it only ties the best flat weight. |
| Both: beat the conventional **declining** (TDF) glide    | **Direction agreed, magnitude tiny.** A monotone-declining retirement glide is dominated in every cell — but the glide _shape_ is worth ≤ ~0.5% of CE under iid and **≈ $0 under the default** (§2f). The spending rule and the equity _level_ dwarf it.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### 3a. Reconciling our constant-$ profile with ACO's

ACO's constant-spending optimum stays **flat ~100% through accumulation** and dips only **at
retirement**; ours **falls through accumulation** to a tent at retirement. Same tent _location_,
different accumulation _approach_. The gap is not a method artifact — both are non-parametric,
per-age optima — it is the assumptions:

1. **Wasted upside vs catastrophic downside (no bequest + capped spending).** A constant-$ retiree
   with bequest weight 0 gets **zero** marginal utility from wealth above what funds the fixed floor
   (you can't spend it, you leave nothing), but **huge** negative utility from landing low
   (depletion). That asymmetry says: don't carry the fat right tail of a 100%-equity accumulation
   into retirement — derisk so the wealth you hand over is _tight_, not _high-mean_. ACO's utility
   still values terminal wealth, so the upside isn't wasted and 100% accumulation pays.
2. **Premium + mean reversion.** ACO's realized history carries a higher equity premium and
   multi-decade mean reversion, so a 100% accumulation almost always recovers in time — cheap
   insurance to stay aggressive. **Pure iid removes that recovery guarantee**, so the sequence
   protection of derisking is worth more under iid than in history.

**§2f resolves this empirically, not just in theory.** Restoring the historical sequencing —
without touching the bequest motive or the premium — is exactly what the default **forward-block
pooled** engine does, and it moves our constant-$ accumulation path from iid's _falling-to-68_ back to
**flat ~100%**, matching ACO. So of the two assumptions above, **(2) the missing sequencing is the
operative one**: the iid tent is mostly a no-sequencing artifact, and the model's _default_ already
behaves like ACO. The bequest channel (1) remains a secondary lever — adding a terminal-wealth motive
would push even the iid path up. Two qualifiers: the channel factorial (§2f) shows the flip is a
**joint** property of the historical process — bond persistence degrading long bond holdings at the
same time as equity's decade-scale reversion de-risks high equity; neither alone, nor the stock/bond
correlation, nor the fat-tailed marginal shapes, reproduces it. "The missing recovery" is therefore
shorthand for that joint structure, not a single equity-side mechanism.
And because JST and ACO's panel draw on largely the **same developed-market historical
episodes**, reproducing ACO's flat-100% here is _consistency_, not independent confirmation. The
honest, default-model conclusion for constant-$ is therefore
**flat ~100% with a shallow dip near retirement** (§2f), with the residual cost borne as depletion
risk; the iid "hold a moderate level and derisk" result (§2e) is the no-mean-reversion bound, useful as
a stress case but not the recommendation.

---

## 4. Caveats — what the iid baseline cannot see

The §2a–§2e sweep is iid Monte Carlo; **§2f and the web app / Python recommender default to
forward-block pooled**, which captures historical sequence structure (equity mean reversion, bond
persistence, single-country clustering) and is what flips the constant-$ result to flat ~100%. The
caveats below apply to the **iid** results (§2a–§2e); the forward-block default already addresses the
first two — they are listed here to bound the iid baseline, not the product.

- **No valuation signal / no mean reversion (iid only).** The iid sweep cannot reproduce ERN's
  _CAPE-conditional_ SWR boost, and (as §2f shows) overstates the constant-$ derisking incentive by
  assuming no recovery. The default forward-block engine preserves the decade-scale equity mean
  reversion from JST history (~VR(10y)≈0.91) and bond persistence (VR>1) in the bootstrap sequences —
  up to roughly the 10-year average block length, attenuated beyond it; neither the
  CAPE-_timing_ signal nor a tradable valuation rule is modeled in either engine.
- **The mean-reversion signal is statistically weak.** VR(10y)≈0.91 is mild, estimated from
  overlapping windows on cross-country-correlated series with ~150 calendar years of effective
  data, and we report no confidence interval; it is likely not distinguishable from VR=1 at
  conventional levels. The **block-length sensitivity** in §2f partly compensates: the flip is a
  step function of "any sequencing vs none" (flat-100% for every average block length ≥ 5y;
  interior tent only at 1y), not a knife-edge in the VR point estimate. Read §2f as the
  realistic-sequencing bracket of an iid↔historical pair, not as a settled point estimate.
- **The flip is a joint-sequencing effect, not a single clean mechanism.** The channel factorial
  (§2f) shows neither the historical stock/bond correlation, nor the non-normal marginal shapes,
  nor equity sequencing alone, nor bond persistence alone reproduces flat-100% — equity-only
  sequencing even _deepens_ the tent via short-run momentum (VR(2y)≈1.1). The result needs bond
  persistence (VR(10y)≈1.7) degrading bonds at the same time as equity's decade-scale reversion
  de-risks high equity. That is an empirical property of the joint historical process — coherent,
  but with no single-parameter knob to stress-test it against. It is also **era-dependent**: the
  1990–2020 inflation-targeting cut lacks it entirely (bonds mean-revert, the optimizer returns
  the tent — §2f era table), though that cut is one 31-year regime that ends just before 2021–22.
  Whether the long-sample structure or the IT-era structure better describes the next 60 years is
  a monetary-regime judgment the data cannot settle; the shallow CE curves (≤ ~2% across
  50–100% equity) keep the welfare cost of guessing wrong small.
- **Survivorship and selection.** JST covers 16 developed markets with long, usable series — markets
  that survived. The recoveries that drive the §2f result are partly a property of that surviving
  sample (the standard critique of ACO applies equally here); investors in markets that closed or
  were expropriated never got their mean reversion.
- **Sequencing is assumed independent of the return level.** The affine rescale shrinks the equity
  premium to ~3.3pp while keeping the historical sequence structure, but historical mean reversion
  arose from valuation cycles at the _historical_ premium. Whether the same recovery dynamics hold
  at a lower forward premium is an untestable maintained assumption.
- **One equity asset, our curve.** No domestic/international split, so ACO's ⅓/⅔ tilt and its
  diversification benefit are out of scope — we test only the _stock-vs-bond_ and _flat-vs-glide_
  axes, on a ~3.3pp premium deliberately lower than ACO's US-tilted history.
- **Fixed-horizon, no mortality, no bequest.** Cleaner "horizon" axis, but it omits longevity risk
  and survival-weighting; and bequest weight 0 is what drives the constant-$ accumulation derisking
  (§3a). A bequest motive pushes every cell toward higher equity.
- **End-of-horizon artifact.** With no bequest the optimizer collapses equity toward 0 in the final
  retirement years — reported as the `end` column and excluded from the `tent`. It is a property of
  a fixed terminal date, not real.
- **CRRA utility, fixed contributions, no taxes/fees, annual rebalancing, 10pp grid.** Standard
  simplifications. **Read shape direction and rough magnitude, not basis points** — with CE gains of
  tenths of a percent, do not over-read a 40% vs 50% retirement-date knot.

## 5. Recommender script

The same model is exposed as a one-call recommender —
[`analysis/glide_path/recommender.py`](../../analysis/glide_path/recommender.py),
`recommend_glide_path(...)` — that **optimizes** (does not look up) the allocation per chosen step
(`interval` = 1y, 5y, …) given your horizons, spending flexibility, guaranteed income, risk
aversion, and selected return mode (including an arbitrary return/vol curve under `iid-mc`). The
default return mode is `forward-block` with `dataset=pooled`. It varies equity against bonds. It
first finds a coordinate-ascent glide, then scores both that glide and the best single constant
allocation on an independent evaluation sample. It always returns the raw optimized glide as the
schedule, plus the robust constant comparator (`flat_equity_pct` / `flat_ce_income`) so callers
can recommend the flat path when it is materially better. It returns the per-step schedule plus
independent-evaluation CE income, income CV, and two depletion views: full-path depletion
(`depletion`), which includes pre-retirement market luck from today, and drawdown-only depletion
(`drawdown_depletion`), which starts from the deterministic expected retirement balance and matches
the `/retirement` headline semantics. "Depletion" in both views means an **income shortfall** — at
least one retirement year in which the portfolio could not fund the targeted draw — not "balance
hit zero" (a year fully covered by guaranteed income has a $0 target and can never count as a
shortfall); the web engine and Python recommender share this definition. It also returns the **best single constant allocation** — the
simpler alternative whose CE the glide path usually beats by only a hair (§2e) — and ships a
`plot_glide_path()` helper.

`python3 analysis/recommend_glide.py --demo` sweeps **each lever across all three spending
rules** under `iid-mc` (the demo's default, since forward-block makes every cell near-flat 100%;
pass `--mode` to sweep under another engine) — holding every other input at its default — and writes
`glide_<spending>_by_<lever>.png` (spending ∈ {`constant`, `semiflex`, `flexible`}; lever ∈
{`guaranteed`, `gamma`}) plus a `glide_by_spending.png` overview to
gitignored `analysis/artifacts/glide_path/demo/`. What each lever does — and how the
effect itself depends on the spending rule:

| Lever                 | Effect on the optimal glide (spending-dependent)                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spending** (`flex`) | rigid → deep retirement tent; flexible → flat ~100% (`glide_by_spending.png`).                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Guaranteed income** | a bigger guaranteed floor lets the portfolio derisk → **deeper, lower tent**. $0 guaranteed income is a permanent zero-income bridge: CE becomes tail-dominated, so its allocation comparison is inconclusive rather than a valid "go for broke" result (§1). |
| **Risk aversion** (γ) | higher γ → lower equity / deeper tent — but mostly under **flexible/semi-flex** spending; the **constant-$ shape is ~γ-invariant** (its tent is driven by the rigid floor, not by taste).                                                                     |

The guaranteed-income panel is the concrete, dial-able form of the §3a reconciliation: for
constant-$ it moves the path between our "derisk" result and ACO's "flat ~100%."

**Additional dials** (beyond the demo matrix), all exposed on both the interactive prompt flow and
the `recommend_glide.py` flag CLI:

- **Guaranteed income amount.** `guaranteed_income` is the real annual dollar amount from CPP, OAS,
  DB pensions, and other income paid **every** retirement year. A pre-pension bridge is out of
  scope. A zero amount recreates the same zero-income state and makes the CE allocation comparison
  inconclusive (see §1).
- **Leverage.** `max_leverage` (1.0 = none; 1.5 = up to 150% equity) lets the optimizer borrow at a
  **real** `borrow_cost` to hold w>1 in the all-equity portfolio (real return `w·eq − (w−1)·borrow`,
  vol `w·eq_vol`; a wipeout is treated as ruin). It leverages only where the risk-adjusted gain beats
  the borrowing drag and survives the independent-evaluation CE guard — typically early accumulation
  under a low γ ("lifecycle investing"). Recommendations therefore use leverage less often than the
  raw coordinate-ascent path when the leveraged upside comes with a fragile left tail.
- **Retirement-consumption γ, by design.** Risk aversion is applied to retirement consumption, not
  directly to accumulation wealth. The user's chosen γ is their preference for _stable retirement
  spending_ — "how hard should the optimizer avoid low spending in bad market draws?" rather than
  "how much equity do you want?" — and may differ from their general investment risk appetite today.
  Higher γ penalizes low retirement-spending outcomes more heavily across simulated market scenarios.
  It is distinct from spending flexibility, which sets how spending _responds_ to portfolio value.
  Accumulation wealth carries no direct utility, but γ still pins down the accumulation glide through
  how that wealth becomes retirement spending; the _declining_ glide also emerges from the
  contribution stream + horizon (human capital). A separate accumulation γ has almost no leverage,
  and a γ(age) gradient would double-count the age–risk relationship the optimizer already produces —
  so neither is offered.
  - _Typical values._ γ = 1 is log utility (aggressive); the literature's plausible band is ~1–10
    with **2–5 the realistic center** (the ~30–40 needed to rationalize historical equity premia is
    the "equity premium puzzle" precisely because it is implausible). The recommender and §2
    analysis sweeps use 4 as the base case. γ's effect on the glide is **spending-rule
    dependent**: under flexible spending a higher γ pulls equity down, but the **constant-$ tent is
    ~γ-invariant** (§2d) because the rigid floor — not taste — drives that shape.
- **β front-loads retirement spending; it discounts retirement years, not years from today.** The
  first retirement year has weight 1, and each subsequent retirement year has β times the previous
  year's weight (`disc[t] = β^t`, length = retirement years; accumulation is undiscounted). A β of 1
  weights every retirement year equally; lower β tilts the optimizer toward funding _earlier, more
  active_ retirement years over later ones. Over 30 years, β of 1, 0.985, and 0.97 give the final
  year about **100%, 65%, and 41%** of the first year's weight.
  - _Typical values._ The default **0.985** ≈ 1.5%/yr — close to the empirical "retirement spending
    smile" (real spending drifts down ~1%/yr in mid-retirement, ≈ β 0.99). **0.97** ≈ 3%/yr is a
    strong early-years tilt; **0.95** ≈ 5%/yr (final-year weight ~23% over 30y) is a _very_ strong
    front-load and atypical; the floor is 0.90. The model has **no separate survival/mortality
    weighting**, so part of any β < 1 a household picks legitimately stands in for declining survival
    probability — the realistic "neutral" point sits a little below 1.0, not exactly at it.

## 6. Reproduce

```bash
python3 -m analysis.glide_path.research             # the analysis (tables + figures), ≈ 5 min
python3 -m analysis.glide_path.recommender          # interactive: prompts for your inputs
python3 analysis/recommend_glide.py --demo          # recommender showcase: 3×2 lever matrix + overview, ≈ 2 min
python3 analysis/recommend_glide.py --help          # scriptable flag CLI for a single custom recommendation

# Regenerate the pre-rescaled JST bundle used by the web app's forward-block engine
python3 -m analysis.glide_path.generate_bundle      # writes src/utils/glide-path/jstData.ts
```

After an interactive run, the recommender prints a copy-pasteable `analysis/recommend_glide.py`
command containing the resolved inputs. The flag CLI exposes the interactive optimizer settings,
including `--beta` and `--paths`, so that command reruns the same simulation and is easy to modify.

Tweak `analysis/glide_path/research.py`'s CONFIG block: `SPENDING_REGIMES` (FLEX levels), `RETIRE_HORIZONS`,
`ACCUM_HORIZONS`, `GAMMA`, `WITHDRAWAL_RATE`, `GRID_STEP`, `OPT_N`/`N_FINAL`/`OPT_PASSES`.
Returns/vol come straight from the `ALLOC_ANCHORS` mirror of
[`presets.ts`](../../src/utils/retirement/presets.ts) — change them there (and here) together. Runtime
≈ 5 min (the per-age coordinate ascent is the cost).

## 7. Discussion — what we actually take away

Qualitative conclusions the quantitative sections support. Each cites its evidence; none is a
new claim.

1. **The welfare surface is flat; the allocation argmax is not.** Across every cut we ran —
   iid vs forward-block, block lengths 5–40y, era and country restrictions — the best constant
   weight moves anywhere from 50% to 100% equity, while the CE spread across that whole range
   stays ≤ ~2–3% (§2e, §2f). The model is far more certain about _how little the choice costs_
   than about _which choice is best_. This is why the product biases toward the simple constant
   allocation (§1, simplicity thresholds): the glide's measurable edge is smaller than the
   model's own uncertainty.
2. **The spending rule and guaranteed income dominate the allocation.** Moving flexibility from
   0 to 1 changes CE by ~$13–16k/yr in every engine (§2b, §2f); moving the equity level across
   its plausible range changes it by ≤ ~$2k. A household debating "60 vs 100% equity" is
   arguing about the third-most-important dial.
3. **The flat-100% recommendation is, at bottom, a monetary-regime judgment.** The joint
   sequence structure that produces it (bond persistence + equity decade-scale reversion) is
   present in 1871–2020 and in the stable-country cut, absent-to-inverted in 1990–2020, and the
   data cannot adjudicate which regime the next 60 years resemble (§2f era table, §4). The two
   engines are best read as scenario brackets — iid: "no recovery, bonds work"; forward-block:
   "history's joint structure persists" — not as a settled point estimate plus a stress case.
4. **Part of the verdict on bonds is about the menu, not the asset class.** The historical
   indictment applies to _nominal long bonds_ in inflationary regimes. Real-return bonds, which
   neutralize most of that channel, exist today but not in the JST sample or in our two-asset
   candidate set — the most consequential modeling gap if one wanted to soften the flat-100%
   conclusion honestly (§4).
5. **Lifecycle-horizon historical inference runs on priors, not power.** 150 years × 16
   correlated countries ≈ a handful of independent 60-year observations. The per-channel
   factorial (§2f) and the variance-ratio diagnostics are how we discipline the story
   economically; nothing here passes a formal significance bar, and the doc deliberately
   reports brackets rather than confidence intervals it cannot honestly compute.
