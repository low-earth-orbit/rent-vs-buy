        This calculator uses a cash-flow method to compare renting and buying on
        an equal footing. Each year, the renter invests the surplus that the
        buyer spends on ownership costs (mortgage payments, property tax,
        maintenance, and insurance) above what the renter pays in rent. At the
        end of the holding period, the owner sells the home — net of selling
        costs and remaining mortgage balance — while the renter liquidates the
        portfolio net of capital gains tax. The option that leaves more
        after-tax net worth wins. Other calculators I recommend:{" "}
