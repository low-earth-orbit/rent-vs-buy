        This is a quick reality check, not a full retirement plan. Results are
        shown in today&apos;s dollars and use a simple glide path — one expected
        return while you&apos;re working and another (usually lower) in
        retirement. It finds the earliest age at which your savings can fund a
        constant gross income target and still last to your planning age in at
        least your chosen share of simulated markets. The retirement phase is
        run as a Monte Carlo simulation with year-to-year return swings to
        capture sequence-of-returns risk; accumulation uses the expected return.
