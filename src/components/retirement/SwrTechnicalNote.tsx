            retirement sustains a higher rate than a 50-year one. The figure

            I checked these rates against 150 years of global market history (18
            countries, 1870–2020): they are in line with what real history would
            have sustained. The takeaway is that the withdrawal rate is driven
            by the return assumption, not by an overly harsh risk model.
