          Most glide-path rules (e.g. &ldquo;100 minus your age&rdquo;,
          target-date funds) are heuristics — they have no explicit link to your
          income target, risk tolerance, or guaranteed income. This tool derives
          an allocation from first principles instead.

          It maximizes welfare, not success rate: where no stock/bond mix can
          close a funding gap, the fix lives in your inputs (retire later, spend
          less, save more), not the allocation. Guaranteed income is assumed to
          start at retirement and be paid every year — a pre-pension
          &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; is out of scope (use the retirement tool for that
          funding question). Income shortfall — a year the portfolio can&apos;t
          fund your targeted spending — is reported two ways: drawdown-only
          (from the expected retirement balance) and full-path (which also
          includes pre-retirement market luck). See the analysis note below for
          how γ and β enter the objective and typical values for each.

          The optimizer runs{" "}
          <Text span fw={600}>
            Monte Carlo coordinate ascent
          </Text>
          : it holds every 5-year step&apos;s weight fixed but one, scans all
          candidate equity weights for that step on a shared set of simulated
          market paths (common random numbers), keeps the best, then repeats for
          every other step — cycling until nothing improves. No parametric shape
          (flat, rising, falling) is assumed; the shape emerges from the math.
          By default, returns come from historical stock and bond sequences (the
          JST Macrohistory cross-country panel) rescaled to our PWL / FP-Canada
          capital-market assumptions in real (today&apos;s) dollars, then
          block-bootstrapped — so the simulations keep history&apos;s sequence
          structure (crashes followed by recoveries) while honoring forward
          return assumptions. An iid Monte Carlo mode with no historical
          sequencing is available via the Simulation toggle.

          Key findings
        </Title>
        <Point heading="The return model and the spending rule set the shape.">
          Under the default historical-sequence engine, the optimizer stays near
          100% equity even with rigid constant-$ spending — history&apos;s
          recoveries make derisking mostly unnecessary, and the residual risk
          shows up as the reported shortfall rates instead. Under the optional
          iid mode (which assumes no recovery), rigid spending derisks into a
          &ldquo;bond tent&rdquo; near retirement. Flexible spending (income
          moves with the market) stays near 100% equity in both.
        </Point>
        <Point heading="The shape is worth little; the level matters.">
          Out of sample, the full per-age glide path beats the best single flat
          weight by only ~0.5% of certainty-equivalent income under the iid
          mode, and essentially nothing under the default engine. Getting the
          equity level right matters far more than optimizing the curve. That is
          why we also report the best{" "}
          <Text span fw={600}>
            constant
          </Text>{" "}
          equity weight: since its outcome is nearly identical and a single
          fixed allocation is far easier to hold through market swings, it is
          often the more practical choice.
        </Point>
        <Point heading="Guaranteed income is your bond floor.">
          A larger guaranteed income (CPP + OAS + DB) lets the portfolio take
          more equity risk because it already covers some downside. With no
          guaranteed income, rare depleted years dominate CRRA utility, so the
          web app requires at least $10,000 per year for a meaningful
          recommendation.
